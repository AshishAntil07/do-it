    doit [add/new/todo]
      asks for id(required), title(required), description, and priority(both optional) - may be very low, low, medium, high, very high.

    doit [search/find]
      asks for id?, query?, and select from filters - having description, completion status, having that much priorities blah blah.

    doit [check/complete/done]
      asks id of the todo to complete. can complete multiple todos if ids are passed separated by comma.

    doit [delete/remove]
      completing doesn't delete the todo, these commands does. similar to completion in its enquiry.
